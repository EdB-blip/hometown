In testing the Mac download version of Joplin, I find that with any pause, and then resume speaking, there is no 'space' put between the two phrases...they simply run together, with the second phrase beginning word capitalized. Am I missing something, or is this 'operator error'?  I have tried to add one manually with the spacebar, but this is hit/miss. Or is this the normal thing with markdown? I am not a regular markdown user, but your Joplin app is worth adopting as a favorite, if I can find a way around this.
